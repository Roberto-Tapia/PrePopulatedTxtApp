# My Awesome Project
This webapp is made up of 2 form inputs in which the user can insert a phone number and a message. A text area will generate an **<** **a** **>** tag with all parameters filled out ready to be embedded into the users own page.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ViteJS, Figma

Too often I notice websites that still list their phone number and require visitors to leave the page, open up their messaging app, copy the phone number correctly, and write a message. All these steps are instance where clients can change their mind. I like what Amazon did with its 2-click buy button. It's a game changer. It increases client retention by reducing the friction involved.

With this tool any developer can input a phone number, and write a message that will create a link that when clicked, will open up the users messaging app with the phone number and message already pre-populated. The user only needs to hit send. 2-click process!

In addition having a pre-populated text message opens the door for automation. When you know what an sms text message is going to contain, you can use marketing tools like HighLevel to build automations that kick off by “listening” for particular words or phrases within sms messages.

For this app I learned React, and learned about state. I used React because I wanted the generated code to be populated instantly on each change the user provided. No need to submit it. 

I also used a border generator that allowed me to implement the design I had created in Figma.

## Optimizations


I would like to make my design more responsive. Although it already looks good I would like it to be wider when accessed on larger screens. 
I'm also planning on adding a button that only appears in larger window sizes. This button will allow the user to copy the generated code, instead of having to select the text and copying manually.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project created using React. I enjoyed the whole process, and found the documentation to be really helpful when getting stuck. I particularly enjoyed working with state to store data. I also learned about using props to pass data from a parent component to a child component. I also learned about Object Destructuring, and although I didn't apply it to this project, it is something I want to use in my next one.
